# Work Day Schedule 

For this oroject we had to build a simple work day schedule that allows a user to save events for each hour
of a typical work day. This project we used thrid party APIs like Bootstrap and jQuery to help run the site.
It was nice to see how using third party APIs to help run the code and not have to write as much of the code and let the API do a lot of the work. Its something I will have to work with and get used to but I can 
see how APIs can and are a great tool to use while building sites.
